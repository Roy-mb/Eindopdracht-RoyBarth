				<h4>What is the halo</h4>
				<p>The halo is a big bar around the cockpit to protect the head of the drivers while they are racing. It was brought into Formula 1 in 2018 after Jules Bianchi passed away after a
				    big collision with a tractor on track in 2014. The halo is fully made out of titanium and can withstand the strength of a 20 KG tire at the speed of 225 kph.

				<h4>When the halo was introduced</h4>
				<p>There was a lot of criticism around the halo when it was first introduced. A lot of drivers and fans said it ruined the esthetics of the car and impacted the vision of the drivers.
					But since the halo was introduced everyone has been proven wrong, there have been some nasty accidents where the halo certtainly saved some lives, in 2018 the halo was also introduced
					in Formula 2, the feeder series of F1.

				<h4>The first incidents</h4>
				<p>The first time the halo proved itsself was in the Formula 2 race in spain, where the car of Fukuzumi landed on top of the halo from Makino's car. A bit later that year, the F1 Belgian grand prix started off.
				   Right at the start of the race Fernando Alonso was hit from behind, causing him to fly over the car of Charles Leclerc, hitting Leclerc's halo with his wheel. These incidents would've been way worse would there not have been a halo to protect the drivers.

				<h4>How the halo saved Romain Grosjean</h4>
				<p>Towards the end of the 2020 F1 season the Bahrain Grand Prix was held in Shakhir. At the start of the race Romain Grosjean collided with Daniil Kvyat resulting in a huge crash.
					Grosjean went face first into a metal barrier causing his car to split in half and catch on fire with the front of the car stuck inside the barrier. Luckily he was able to climb out and escape with minor burns. Later it was released that Grosjeans head would've been decapitated if the halo did'nt exist.\

				<h4>The Hamilton Verstappen crash</h4>
				<p>At the 2021 Italian Grand Prix in Monza, Hamilton and Verstappen were going side by side towards Turn 1. When they arrived at the corner Hamilton and Verstappen hit eachother causing Verstappen to fly over the car of Hamilton. The tire of Verstappen slightly hit the head of Hamilton, but fortunately everyone was okay.
			       It was clear that the halo saved Hamilton though, since his head would've been hit even harder if the halo wasn't a thing.

				<h4>The halo at the 2022 British Grand Prix</h4>
				<p>The halo did also did an amazing job at the 2022 British Grand Prix. In the F2 race on sunday the halo saved the live of Roy Nissany after Dennis Hauger flew across the track right on top of the halo from Nissany.
				   A few hours later at the start of the F1 race, Guanyu Zhou was flipped upside down and skittered across the track before flying over the tire barrier and coming to a stop. Without the halo his head would've probably been injured because his head was exposed to the track surface while being upside down.
